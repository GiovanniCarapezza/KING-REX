Folder 1 to 6 contain data and scripts to replicate all data of  the section "Results".

In particular:

Folder 1 contains IGV files for assay selection

Folder 2 contains scripts and data of section "Evaluation of KING-REX performance in detecting kinase gene expression"

Folder 3 contains scripts and data of section "Evaluation of KING-REX performance in predicting kinase fusion events"

Folder 4 contains scripts and data of section "KING-REX limits of detection in gene expression"

Folder 5 contains scripts and data of section "KING-REX limits of detection in gene fusion prediction"

Folder 6 contains scripts and data of section "KING-REX performance with degraded RNA"


The other folders  and files (see below A-C) contain raw data and annotation data required for scripts of folders 1-6.

A) annotations_KING-REX.txt -> annotation file
B) annotations_Transcriptome.txt -> annotation file

C) raw_counts1.zip, raw_counts2.zip and raw_counts3.zip must be unzipped.
They contain the folders:
	raw_counts_CCLE,
	raw_counts_KING-REX,
	raw_counts_transcriptome
