Folder 1 to 6 contain data and scripts to replicate all data of  the section "Results".

In particular:

Folder 1 contains IGV files for assay selection

Folder 2 contains scripts and data of section "Evaluation of KING-REX performance in detecting kinase gene expression"

Folder 3 contains scripts and data of section "Evaluation of KING-REX performance in predicting kinase fusion events"

Folder 4 contains scripts and data of section "KING-REX limits of detection in gene expression"

Folder 5 contains scripts and data of section "KING-REX limits of detection in gene fusion prediction"

Folder 6 contains scripts and data of section "KING-REX performance with degraded RNA"


The other folders  and files (see below) contain raw data and annotation data required for scripts of folders 1-6:
annotations_KING-REX.txt
annotations_Transcriptome.txt
Raw_counts1,Raw_counts2 and Raw_counts3 must be unzipped. 
They contain:
	raw_counts_CCLE,
	raw_counts_KING-REX,
	raw_counts_transcriptome
